# 2D_4classes_mri_classification

This project is about using Pytorch for 2D MRI image classification using transfer learning with Resnet34 with a testing accuracy is 98%.

The images are downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images). These images will be classified into four categories, including 

NOD: Non Demented, \
VMD: Very Mild Demented, \
MID: Mild Demented, \
MOD: Moderate Demented.
